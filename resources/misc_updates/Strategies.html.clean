## General advice[edit | edit source]

  * Overloads will not let you drink a dose if you have less than 51 hitpoints. 
    * If you use a locator orb or dwarven rock cake at too low of Hitpoints while the overload still has damage left to deal, you will die.
  * Absorption potions are most efficiently used with 1 Hitpoints accomplished with a dwarven rock cake or locator orb. Having 1 Hitpoints means any damage taken has a max hit of 1, at most draining a single absorption point. 2 Hitpoints means it is possible to take a max hit of 2, draining the points faster. 
    * To remain at 1 Hitpoints, flick Rapid Heal on and then off about every 50 seconds.
    * Combining this benefit with Dharok the Wretched's equipment is a good training method for those with higher than 92 Hitpoints, otherwise the Obsidian armour set, berserker necklace, and Toktz-xil-ak or strength bonus equipment are better.
    * Use the dwarven rock cake _right-click_ option _Guzzle_ to get to 1 Hitpoints, the _eat_ option **only** brings Hitpoints down to 2.
  * Leaving the Nightmare Zone arena resets all stats.
  * In rumble mode: 
    * Completing all quests will reduce costs by 10,000 per run.
    * More bosses enabled rewards a higher percentage of their total points per kill. Disabling bosses that are unlocked from completing quests reduces points per kill.
    * Some bosses are recommended to almost always be disabled based on their mechanics: Glod, Elvarg, Corrupt Lizardman, Chronozon, and Barrelchest.
    * Disabling a boss also disables every boss from that quest, e.g. disabling Damis also disables Dessous, Fareed, Kamil. Because of this mechanic all bosses from Dream Mentor, Recipe for Disaster, and Desert Treasure should always be enabled when trying to maximise points per hour.
    * Some bosses provide increased experience per damage dealt: Moss Guardian (+7.5%; 4.3xp), Dad (+10%; 4.4xp), Ice Troll King (+12.5%; 4.5xp), and Arrg (+17.5%; 4.7xp).
    * Avoid using Ultimate Force power-ups unless there are many bosses that you cannot damage.
    * Activate all other power-ups. With Power Surge, use a special attack weapon such as dragon claws or granite maul with an ornate handle. Damage dealt by Zapper or Recurrent Damage does not yield experience, but they do not usually impact experience rates unless the player kills bosses too quickly.

## Getting your first points[edit | edit source]

If it is your first time playing Nightmare Zone, you will not have any points
for absorptions or overloads. Follow either the **Melee (Prayer)** setup below
with the recommended bosses or use hard endurance mode, killing every boss up
to Elvarg. If equipped, you can attempt to go further, but it may be less
efficient.

Playing on normal difficulty is also an option, however the amount of time and
money it takes to earn a sustainable amount of points will increase as well as
some bosses like Ice Troll King and Jungle Demon using more attack styles than
just melee making it harder to survive.

For hard endurance dreams, the following bosses require special mechanics or
extra items brought with you, making it far less AFK:

  * Corrupt Lizardman \- Poison protection
  * Elvarg \- Anti-dragon shield equipped - provided
  * Slagilith \- Optional: Pickaxe - provided
  * Dagannoth mother \- Only takes one type of damage in one form at a time
  * Dad \- Stuns and knocks back
  * Tanglefoot \- Equip Magic secateurs to deal damage - provided
  * Headless Beast \- Drops rock from the ceiling when in melee range
  * Glod \- Disables and drains Prayer, causes you to run towards or away from him
  * Flambeed \- Equip ice gloves to deal damage
  * Gelatinnoth Mother \- Only takes one type of damage in one form at a time
  * Karamel \- Drains stats and Prayer, interrupts auto-retaliate and movement
  * Chronozon \- Can only be killed after using all four blast spells
  * Giant Roc \- Stuns and knocks back
  * Damis \- Second form drains Prayer quickly.
  * Fareed \- Equip ice gloves to deal damage
  * Kamil \- Interrupts movement
  * Barrelchest \- Deals high damage, drains Prayer and Defence, turns off protection prayers before attacking.
  * Elven traitor \- High damage and prayer disabling arrows
  * Essyllt \- Long ranged attacks, stat drain and stuns

## Experience and points balance[edit | edit source]

Ironmen looking to imbue a slayer helmet or berserker ring can use a setup
that balances points and experience to conserve Prayer potions and compensate
for restricted access to Dharok the Wretched's equipment or Obsidian armour.
Use the Optimal experience setup - #Melee (Absorption, AFK) method below, but
use customisable **hard** rumble and the same bosses.

This yields approximately 250,000 points per hour and melee experience of
between 50,000 and 60,000 per hour at 65 and higher attack, strength, and
defence, and 80,000 per hour at 75 and higher, continuing to scale with higher
combat levels.

## Optimal experience setups[edit | edit source]

This setup uses a mix of strength and prayer bonus and is a fairly AFK
strategy for experience and Nightmare Zone points. Players can gain up to
around 90,000 melee experience and 400,000 Nightmare Zone points per hour.
This requires prayer potions, somewhat expensive and worse overall for melee
training, but does not require expensive gear and is more AFK.

  * A special attack weapon for Power Surge to increase damage output or replenish Prayer points
  * 4-6 overloads or super combat potions
  * Prayer potions or super restores
  * Holy wrench (optional, if the number of prayer restore doses in your inventory is greater than 4 x prayer points restored in one dose, it is worth having instead of another potion)

## Bosses[edit | edit source]

Select customisable hard rumble and choose at least five from the bosses
below. Choose more than five to increase points per hour. They use melee only,
are attackable with melee, and have no special mechanics that can kill you. It
is ordered by defence, ascending:

  * Trapped Soul \- The Ascent of Arceuus
  * Count Draynor \- Vampyre Slayer
  * Sand Snake \- The Depths of Despair
  * King Roald \- What Lies Below
  * The Kendal \- Mountain Daughter
  * Me \- Lunar Diplomacy
  * Skeleton Hellhound \- In Search of the Myreque
  * Tree spirit \- Lost City
  * Dad \- Troll Stronghold (Frequent knockback attack)
  * Khazard warlord \- Tree Gnome Village
  * Black Knight Titan \- Holy Grail
  * Ice Troll King \- The Fremennik Isles (attacks only with Melee in hard rumble)
  * Bouncer \- Fight Arena
  * Black Demon \- The Grand Tree
  * Jungle Demon \- Monkey Madness I (attacks only with Melee in hard rumble)

### Not selected[edit | edit source]

The bosses below can only attack with melee, but they should not be selected.

  * Nazastarool \- Shilo Village (Has multiple forms, which reduces the points per hour)
  * Treus Dayth \- Haunted Mine (Disappears frequently, which reduces the points per hour)
  * Witch's Experiment \- Witch's House (Has multiple forms, which reduces the points per hour)

## Strategy[edit | edit source]

Activate Protect from Melee and boost. When using divine super combat potions,
maintain Hitpoints by activating Rapid Heal.

Damage boosting prayers such as Piety or Ultimate Strength can be used to
increase experience and points per hour, but it increases prayer drain,
requiring more attention and prayer potions.

Do **not** activate Ultimate Force. Activate Zapper and Recurrent Damage to
increase points per hour, this may slightly affect experience gained. Activate
Power Surge, use your special attack weapon, it lasts 45 seconds.

Dharok the Wretched's equipment with absorptions requires more attention than
the other setups, but offers the fastest Attack and Strength experience of up
to 180,000 experience per hour using dragon claws for special attacks during
Power Surge, or up to 155,000 with a granite maul with an ornate handle. It is
recommended to only use the setup with
![Hitpoints](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/images/thumb/Hitpoints_icon.png/21px-
Hitpoints_icon.png?a4819) 92 Hitpoints or greater because of the set effect
increasing damage when missing more HP. Switches can be brought for strength
bonus during Power Surge. The rest of the equipment maximises strength and
accuracy bonuses. It is possible to sustain around 1 hour per dream with this
setup.

  * Dragon claws, granite maul (or), or granite maul for special attacks
  * Neitiznot faceguard and Bandos chestplate switches for special attacks (optional)
  * 3 Overloads
  * 3-5 Absorptions
  * Locator orb or dwarven rock cake
  * Prayer potions or super restores
  * Holy wrench (optional, if the number of prayer restore doses in your inventory is greater than 4 x prayer points restored in one dose, it is worth having instead of another potion)

## Bosses[edit | edit source]

Select customisable hard rumble, choose the following five bosses:

  * Count Draynor \- Vampyre Slayer
  * Sand Snake \- The Depths of Despair
  * Headless Beast \- Getting Ahead
  * Moss Guardian \- Roving Elves
  * Arrg \- Troll Romance

Optionally swap out Sand Snake with Dad. Dad grants +5% extra experience, but
does stun regularly. Only recommended with very high stats while paying
attention.

  * Dad \- Troll Stronghold

## Strategy[edit | edit source]

Run to any corner except the south-east corner, drink all your absorptions and
sip a dose of overload. Feel the Locator orb or guzzle the dwarven rock cake
down to 1 Hitpoints. Quickly turn on and off Rapid Heal to reset Hitpoints
regeneration. Turn on Piety and attack or use auto-retaliate.

Drink prayer potions as needed, flick Rapid Heal on and off once every 50-60
seconds to avoid regenerating to 2 Hitpoints. This maximises damage dealt and
minimises absorption points used. If your Hitpoints goes above 1, feel the
locator orb or guzzle the dwarven rock cake, if it is not working run away
temporarily. As the overload expires, either run or turn on protection prayers
temporarily to avoid wasting absorption points, drink another dose of overload
and continue as before.

Experienced prayer flickers can set up quick-prayers to simultaneously
activate Rapid Heal and their best offensive prayer. This improves damage
output, stops accidental regeneration, and maximises Prayer points without
using prayer potions, but this requires significantly more effort and
attention.

Do **not** activate Ultimate Force. Activate Zapper and Recurrent Damage to
increase points per hour, this may slightly affect experience gained only if
you normally kill the bosses before new ones take their place. Activate Power
Surge, switch equipment and use your special attack weapon, it lasts 45
seconds.

Using normal customisable rumble with absorptions allows for 20 minutes of AFK
melee training. After 20 minutes, the player will stop attacking and must
manually start attacking again to reset the timer. Players can gain up to
85,000–90,000 experience per hour, and sustain for 3–6 hours per session
depending on equipment and stats. While this method does earn slightly more
Nightmare Zone points than spent on absorptions, players looking to solely
gain points are advised to use other setups. It is possible to use this setup
on customisable hard mode; however, bosses hit much harder in the hard mode,
requiring more absorption potions. This does net more points (250k/hr+) and is
a good mix of points and experience, especially for Ironmen looking to imbue
items. Players looking to gain more experience per hour are advised to use the
Dharok's setup for much faster experience.

## Equipment[edit | edit source]

The ghrazi rapier, inquisitor's mace, or Blade of saeldor (c) with Bandos
armour offers the best experience per hour with good sustainability due to its
high defences. Toktz-xil-ak along with full obsidian armour and berserker
necklace offers the next best experience per hour and is a more affordable
option, however it has much worse sustainability due to low defensive stats.
Players who want sustainability but cannot afford a ghrazi rapier can use an
abyssal whip (for training Attack or Defence) or abyssal bludgeon (for
training Strength) along with Bandos armour.

  * 4-5 super combat potions
  * Locator orb or dwarven rock cake (optional but recommended)
  * Absorptions

## Bosses[edit | edit source]

Select customisable normal rumble choosing bosses that attack with melee, are
attackable with melee, and have no special mechanics. Count Draynor, Sand
Snake, King Roald, The Kendal, and Me are the usual selection because they
have lower defence but not extremely low Hitpoints. Note that enemies that
occupy multiple tiles, like the Kendal and Sand Snake, may block each other
and prevent the player from auto-retaliating. While the Khazard Warlord deals
more damage, he has very high Hitpoints for his level, which makes him a good
option for better experience rates. Select more than five bosses to earn more
points.

  * Trapped Soul \- The Ascent of Arceuus
  * Count Draynor \- Vampyre Slayer
  * Sand Snake \- The Depths of Despair
  * King Roald \- What Lies Below
  * The Kendal \- Mountain Daughter
  * Me \- Lunar Diplomacy
  * Tree spirit \- Lost City
  * Khazard Warlord \- Tree Gnome Village

Not recommended:

  * Nazastarool (Shilo Village): Has multiple forms which reduces points per hour, although this does not affect experience rates.
  * Black Knight Titan (Holy Grail): Deals high damage, which lowers sustainability.
  * Bouncer (Fight Arena): Deals high damage, which lowers sustainability.

## Strategy[edit | edit source]

Run to the middle of the arena. Use absorptions until 951-1000 absorption
points, and optionally feel a locator orb or guzzle a dwarven rock cake down
to 1 Hitpoints then sip a super combat potion. Repeat every 15–20 minutes.

Using a locator orb or a dwarven rock cake is optional but allows for longer
sessions, minimising the amount of absorption points used to tank damage
(especially using obsidian armour).

Using a customisable normal rumble with absorptions maximises AFK time and
allows for 20 minutes of AFK ranged training. After 20 minutes the player will
stop attacking and must interact with the client to start attacking again.
Players can gain up to 90,000–95,000 experience per hour when using a toxic
blowpipe, or 70,000 experience with a magic shortbow (i). It is possible to
sustain 3–5 hours per session depending on equipment and stats. While this
method does earn slightly more Nightmare Zone points than spent on
absorptions, players looking to gain points are advised to use other setups.
It is possible to use this setup on customisable hard mode, but only
recommended if not being as AFK. Bosses hit a lot harder in the hard mode, so
it is much more important to flick Rapid Heal and use a locator orb or dwarven
rock cake.

## Equipment[edit | edit source]

Recommended weapons are listed below, from best to worst.

  * Toxic blowpipe with amethyst darts
  * Amethyst or adamant darts with the twisted buckler
  * Bow of faerdhinen (c)
  * Mithril darts with the twisted buckler
  * Magic shortbow (i) with amethyst or rune arrows
  * Rune crossbow with runite or broad bolts

If using a one-handed weapon, such as darts, it is strongly recommended to use
the twisted buckler for its high Ranged strength bonus.

Void Knight equipment is generally the best option for most players, as it is
more accessible than the Masori armour and it offers better damage output than
Armadyl or dragonhide armour. If using the toxic blowpipe or darts, the Masori
armour offers slightly higher damage output than Void Knight equipment. The
crystal armour can be used with the bow of faerdhinen for slightly higher
damage output, though this will use a lot of charges.

  * 4–5 super ranging potions
  * Locator orb or dwarven rock cake (optional but recommended)
  * Absorptions

## Bosses[edit | edit source]

Select customisable normal rumble choosing bosses which are attackable with
ranged and have no special mechanics. Count Draynor, Sand Snake, King Roald,
The Kendal, and Me are the usual selection because they have lower defence but
not extremely low Hitpoints. Viable bosses are listed below, select five with
the lowest defence for more experience per hour or as many as you can for more
points per hour.

  * Trapped Soul \- The Ascent of Arceuus
  * Count Draynor \- Vampyre Slayer
  * Sand Snake \- The Depths of Despair
  * King Roald \- What Lies Below
  * The Kendal \- Mountain Daughter
  * Me \- Lunar Diplomacy
  * Tree spirit \- Lost City
  * Khazard Warlord \- Tree Gnome Village

## Strategy[edit | edit source]

Run to the middle. Drink absorptions until 951-1000 absorption points. Feel
the locator orb or guzzle the dwarven rock cake to lower down to 1 Hitpoints
(optional but recommended), and sip a super ranging potion. Repeat after 15–20
minutes or as necessary.

Bursting is **not** recommended here as there are far better ways to do so,
this setup utilises standard spells. In general it is not recommended to train
Magic at Nightmare Zone, however it is still possible. This equipment
prioritises Magic damage boost, followed by magic accuracy and melee defensive
bonuses.

  * 4-5 super magic or battlemage potions
  * Runes for highest fire-based standard spell or highest offensive spell (Runepouch optional)
  * Locator orb or dwarven rock cake (optional but highly recommended)
  * Absorptions

## Bosses[edit | edit source]

Select customisable normal rumble choosing bosses that are attackable with
magic and have no special mechanics. Count Draynor, Sand Snake, King Roald,
The Kendal, and Me are the usual selection because they have lower defence but
not extremely low Hitpoints. Viable bosses are listed below:

  * Trapped Soul \- The Ascent of Arceuus
  * Count Draynor \- Vampyre Slayer
  * Sand Snake \- The Depths of Despair
  * King Roald \- What Lies Below
  * The Kendal \- Mountain Daughter
  * Me \- Lunar Diplomacy

## Strategy[edit | edit source]

Run to the middle. Drink absorptions until 951-1000 absorption points, and
optionally feel locator orb or guzzle a dwarven rock cake to 1 Hitpoints, and
sip a Super magic potion or battlemage potion. Repeat after 15–20 minutes or
as necessary.

Using a locator orb or a dwarven rock cake is optional but allows for longer
sessions, minimizing the amount of absorption points used to tank damage
(especially using void knight equipment).

## Optimal point setups[edit | edit source]

Have as many bosses from the recommended lists activated as possible,
especially from Dream Mentor, Recipe for Disaster, and Desert Treasure.

Using Dharok the Wretched's equipment is optimal with
![Hitpoints](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/images/thumb/Hitpoints_icon.png/21px-
Hitpoints_icon.png?a4819) 92+ Hitpoints, without that the best is a toktz-xil-
ak, obsidian armour, and a Berserker necklace. Otherwise use the best
available strength bonus gear or Void Knight equipment.

  * 4 overloads
  * 20 absorption potions
  * Special attack weapon for Power Surge
  * Dwarven rock cake or Locator orb
  * Ice gloves for Fareed and Flambeed
  * 1 Prayer potion for emergency

## Strategy[edit | edit source]

During the 25 second countdown before bosses start spawning, boost with an
overload, consume 1000 points of absorption points, and feel the Locator orb
or guzzle the dwarven rock cake down to 1 Hitpoints. Quickly flick Rapid Heal
on and then off to reset the Hitpoints regeneration timer and do so every
50-60 seconds to maintain 1 Hitpoints. If your Hitpoints ever regen to 2, use
the Locator orb or rock cake again to get back to 1 Hitpoint.

When your overload is about to run out, make sure you have 200+ points of
Absorption remaining, and as soon as it runs out use another dose. Try to
avoid being attacked as much as possible while the overload reduces you from
51 to 1 Hitpoints, to prevent wastage of Absorption points. Follow the boss
kill priority list provided to maximise points gained.

Do **not** use Ultimate Force power-up unless there are too many bosses that
cannot be killed easily. Always use the Power Surge power-up and use the
special attack weapon constantly. Use Recurrent Damage and Zapper whenever for
higher points per hour.

A prayer potion should be used after suffering prayer-draining attacks from
Karamel to ensure you can still flick Rapid Heal or activate Protect from
Melee when your overload expires. Protect from Magic can be used against
Karamel to minimise her stat drains.

## Bosses[edit | edit source]

Select customizable hard rumble. Make sure the following bosses are disabled:

  * Corrupt Lizardman
  * Elvarg
  * Glod
  * Chronozon
  * Barrelchest

This is the kill priority of enabled bosses based on time-to-kill per points
awarded using the best in slot items above.

---|---|---  
1 | Karamel | Cancels auto-retaliate and movement

Using the best Ranged equipment is optimal, but some bosses have very high
Ranged defence, so it is recommended to bring a Magic switch. Elite Void
Knight equipment or Void Knight equipment is not recommended, however they can
be used if lacking Ranged equipment, especially for ironmen. 61 Magic is the
minimum requirement to be able to cast Fire Wave with an overload potion.

![Prayer
potion\(4\).png](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/images/Prayer_potion\(4\).png?219da)  
  
  * 4 overloads
  * 20 absorption potions
  * Special attack weapon for Power Surge
  * Dwarven rock cake or Locator orb
  * Ice gloves for Fareed and Flambeed
  * 1 Prayer potion for emergency
  * Optional: Magic switch for auto-casting spells

## Strategy[edit | edit source]

Boost with an overload, consume 1000 points of absorption points, and feel the
Locator orb or guzzle the dwarven rock cake down to 1 Hitpoints. Quickly turn
on and off Rapid Heal to reset Hitpoints regeneration and do so every 50-60
seconds to maintain 1 Hitpoints.

Follow the boss kill priority list provided to maximise points gained.

Target the following bosses with Magic if you brought a switch:

  * Black Knight Titan
  * Ice Troll King
  * Chronozon - Attack with all four blast spells

Do not use Ultimate Force power-up unless there are too many bosses to deal
with. Always use the Power Surge power-up and use the special attack weapon
constantly. Use Recurrent Damage and Zapper whenever possible.

A Prayer potion should be used after suffering prayer-draining attacks from
Karamel to ensure you can still flick rapid heal or activate protect from
melee when your overload expires. Protect from Magic can be used against
Karamel to minimise her stat drains.

## Bosses[edit | edit source]

Make sure the following bosses are disabled:

  * Barrelchest
  * Black Knight Titan
  * Chronozon \- Can be enabled if bringing a Magic switch
  * Corrupt Lizardman
  * Elvarg
  * Glod

The following bosses have long kill times and are recommended to be disabled
unless you bring a Magic switch:

  * Ice Troll King

This is the kill priority of enabled bosses based on time-to-kill per points
awarded using the best in slot items above.

Priority | Boss | Reason  
---|---|---  
1 | Karamel | Cancels auto-retaliate and movement  
Drains Prayer, Protect from Magic counters  
2 | Kamil | Cancels auto-retaliate and movement

4 | Agrith-Naar | Teleports player into melee range

36 | Treus Dayth |  
37 | Trapped Soul |  
38 | Nazastarool |  
39 | Corsair Traitor | Drains Defence by 15%  
40 | Slagilith | Optional: Equip pickaxe  
Non-pickaxe damage is reduced by 66%.  
41 | Witch's experiment | First form drains Defence by 5%  
42 | Ice Troll King | With a Melee switch  
43 | Black Knight Titan | With a Melee switch  
44 | Damis | Avoid attacking, kill with ultimate force if possible  
Second form drains Prayer quickly  
  
This method utilises disabling Dream Mentor and Desert Treasure bosses due to
a mechanic, where if Dream Mentor is enabled but Desert Treasure is not, point
rewards are reduced to one sixth of their original value.[1] To maximise AFK,
disabling Desert Treasure and Recipe for Disaster bosses is preferable due to
the bosses either being click-intensive or requiring attention, and disable
Dream Mentor to avoid the point penalty.

## Gear[edit | edit source]

The gear recommended for this method in order of best to worst is on other
parts of the strategy page: Dharok, Obsidian, highest strength gear, or mixed
Strength bonus and Prayer gear.

## Strategy[edit | edit source]

Boost with an overload, consume 1000 points of absorption points, and feel the
Locator orb or guzzle the dwarven rock cake down to 1 Hitpoints. Quickly turn
Rapid Heal on and off to reset Hitpoints regeneration and do so every 50-60
seconds to maintain 1 Hitpoints. Make sure Auto Retaliate is on.

Follow the boss kill priority list provided to maximise points gained.

**Never** use Ultimate Force power-up. Always use the Power Surge power-up and
use the special attack weapon constantly. Use Recurrent Damage and Zapper
whenever for higher points per hour.

## Bosses[edit | edit source]

Make sure the following bosses are disabled:

  * Recipe for Disaster and Desert Treasure bosses (due to non-AFK mechanics) 
    * Dream Mentor bosses (due to point penalty if Desert Treasure is off)
  * Corrupt Lizardman (deals poison through absorption potions)
  * Elvarg (drains stats and prayer points)
  * Chronozon (requires casting 4 different magic spells)
  * Dagannoth mother (requires actively switching attack style)
  * Barrelchest (drains prayer)
  * Glod (drains prayer)
  * Witch's experiment (4-phase boss with low point reward)
  * Nazastarool (3-phase boss)
  * Slagilith (66% reduced damage for non-pickaxes)
  * Tanglefoot (Requires secateurs to damage)

Optional disables that will make it more AFK, but less points per hour:

  * Giant Roc (due to stun and knock back)
  * Dad (due to stun and knock back)
  * Essyllt (due to stat drain and a short stun)
  * Treus Dayth (moves around after damage)

This is the kill priority of enabled bosses based on time-to-kill per points
awarded using the best in slot items.
