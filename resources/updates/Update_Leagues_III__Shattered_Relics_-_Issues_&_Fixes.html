<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Renown_and_Task_Rebalancing">Renown and Task Rebalancing</span></h2>
<p>It's been wonderful to see so many of you getting stuck into Shattered Relics.
</p><p>We know many of you are thoroughly enjoying the extra levels of planning and thought that can be applied to this League, and we're really starting to see how creative you can be with Fragments and their Set Effects. There are some seriously powerful combinations you've created!
</p><p>We've also seen the feedback from many of you suggesting that the restrictions in place are too limiting, and that the time to reach the power levels offered from the various Fragments and Set Effects are taking too long obtain.
</p><p>We want to ensure the League is an enjoyable experience from the start. We'd like to help alleviate these concerns somewhat, and so we've decided to rebalance the Renown cost required to unlock new Skills and Bosses.
</p><p>Note: those of you that have already unlocked Skills and Bosses with Renown prior to these changes will have the difference refunded back to you. Happy spending!
</p><p>In addition to this, we're planning on rebalancing some of the task requirements that are not as easily achievable in the time that the Shattered Relics League will be available.
</p><p>Check out the below images for more information and let us know what you think before these changes go live in this week's game update!

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Group_Storage_Lost_Items">Group Storage Lost Items</span></h2>
<p><b>January 21st - 17:00 GMT</b>
</p><p>Following our investigations into the Group Storage lost items issue, we have successfully identified all groups that were impacted and lost items as a result of the rollback performed on January 19th.
</p><p>We are currently in the process of developing a system that will allow us to return most of what was lost to the groups impacted. This work should be complete soon and we hope to begin the item restoration process following next week's game update.
</p><p>If your group was impacted, each member of your group should receive an inbox message from us providing more information within the next 24 hours to their Group Iron account.
</p><p>We can confirm that some groups were able to benefit from this and gained additional items in their Group Storage as a result. After further investigation we have determined the impact of these gains are not concerning, and we will not be taking further action against these groups.
</p><p>Thank you for your continued patience as we've worked to resolve this issue.
</p><p><b>January 19th - 18:00 GMT</b>
</p><p>We've received some reports regarding some Group Ironman players losing items that were connected to their Group Storage.
</p><p>Group Storage is a relatively new system, and its data is stored in a separate location from your player's own save file. This means any changes that were made to your Group Storage during the hour before the rollback have persisted.
</p><p>The result of this is that any items withdrawn from Group Storage during that timeframe have been lost, and any items placed into Group Storage during that hour have been duplicated.
</p><p>We believe a relatively low number of players/items have been impacted by this, but we are still investigating. It’s likely that we’ll have more accurate information in the morning. We are confident that we'll be able identify any GIM player who was impacted, so you won't need to report this to us directly.
</p><p>We are currently investigating into potential solutions for this. It most certainly won't be an overnight fix and we really appreciate your patience as we look to resolve this.
</p><p>We will have more to share with you soon and we apologise for the inconvenience this has caused.

<center><i>January 19th - 16:15 GMT</i></center>
<p>Upon configuring some new worlds for use in Leagues III, we identified some issues with the new worlds that were affecting both main and leagues save profiles.
</p><p>Once the issue was discovered, the decision was made to perform a rollback to main game accounts (to a save state just before the update launched).
</p><p>Originally this was going to affect all accounts, however, we were able to keep the current progress of all accounts that had any Leagues progress with the only caveat being a wipe of the Leagues HiScores.
</p><p>After the backup saves were restored and internal testing was completed, the game was put back online, along with the additional nine worlds we originally planned to launch.
</p><p><b>Total downtime: 3 hours</b>

<center>✨Leagues III: Shattered Relics is off to a fantastic start!
<p>🌏 With so many of you stealing from innocent NPC's and emptying the ocean of fish, we need to add more worlds.
</p><p>📜 Keep an eye on this thread for more info as we begin to add additional support.

</p><p>📣 We're currently investigating into issues with the new worlds being added.
</p><p>We'll look to update you once these have been resolved and the worlds are live.
</p><p>Thank you for your patience.

</p><p>📣 Due to issues with League save profiles, we are going to be shutting the game down very shortly.
</p><p>Unfortunately, we are required to perform a rollback to just before the launch of Leagues III.
</p><p>Apologies for the inconvenience and we will update you with more information soon.

</p><p>UPDATE: We've identified that the rollback will only be required for main game progress, setting players back to just before the update.
</p><p>The Hiscores for Leagues will be reset, but all progress made on a Leagues world will be available when the game is back online.

</p><p>📣 Internal testing has begun on the restored save profiles following our rollback.
</p><p>Once we're happy that everything is good, we'll be able to relaunch the worlds!
</p><p>We'll share an ETA as soon as we're able to.
</p><p>Thank you so much for your patience so far!

</p><p>📣 We have some good news to share!
</p><p>Significant progress has been made on our internal testing, allowing us to bring the worlds up earlier than expected!
</p><p>We are aiming for the worlds to start appearing back online at 16:00 GMT, approximately 20 minutes from now.

</p><p>📣 We are pleased to announce the game is back online!
</p><p>All game worlds should be available including the nine additional Leagues worlds.
</p><p>Thank you for your patience and support as the team worked to resolve the issues!
