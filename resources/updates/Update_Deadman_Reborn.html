</td>
<td><b>(13:30 BST)</b> In Deadman: Reborn, Tier 5 Emblems can only be obtained from Slayer creatures that are your current Slayer task. These creatures must also be over 100 Combat.
<p>It's important to note that Deadman: Reborn is not entirely the same as previous Deadman events and changes should be expected. However, this wasn't made clear enough in our blogs, and we apologise.
</p><p>We've changed it so that you can now get Tier 1 and Tier 5 Emblems from <b>ANY NPC</b> even if they are not your Slayer task.
</p><p>Emblems will now always be a Tier 5 if the target is your Slayer task or if the NPC is above 100 Combat level.
</p><p>In addition to this we've also greatly increased the chance of an Emblem whilst in Single-way combat.

</td>
<td><b>(13:30 BST)</b> We agree that the Ancient statuettes are too powerful to exist within a time limited gamemode and as a result, we've removed them from all Revenant NPC drop tables.
<p>In order to implement this, we've had to replace the following drops with a Dragon Med helm:<br />
Ancient statuettes<br />
Ancient crystal<br />
Yew seed<br />
Magic seed

<p><i>This week it's all about the exciting return of Deadman: Reborn! Whether you’re a DMM die-hard or a newcomer to this punishing PvP mode, today we have all the information you could possibly need, from new rules to riveting rewards. Plus, there’s more 20 Year Anniversary merch and a few extra tweaks to keep things sweet. Let’s go!</i>
</p>

<p>Old School's most intense PvP Tournament is back, and it’s more brutal than ever. Players have three weeks to survive and skill to qualify for the Finals – and one epic day to be crowned the last Deadman standing!
</p><p>Even if you’re not ready to spend your September slaughtering your fellow players in an epic battle to the finish line, it’s worth getting acquainted with this ruthless game mode, because it really does showcase the best combatants in the RuneScape community. Trust us, you won’t want to miss the nail-biting Finale streaming on Twitch on September 17th!
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="What_is_Deadman?">What is Deadman?</span></h2>
<p>Deadman is an intense PvP (player-vs-player) survival game mode, with high risks and serious rewards. It’s not for the faint-hearted – it's frenetic, frustrating and thrilling in equal measure. Your wits and prowess will be put to the test, and the winner can quite rightly declare themselves the best of the best.
</p><p>Deadman: Reborn takes place over three weeks, and for the first time, players will have three lives to help them make it to the Finale. Once those lives are gone, though, it’s back to the drawing board (well, Lumbridge).
</p><p>All you need to take part (apart from nerves of steel) is <b>an existing account with an active Membership</b>. Much like with Leagues, each player starts their journey from scratch on Tutorial Island on a dedicated individual world. From there you can chat to Skippy and he’ll offer you a choice of starting locations. As soon as you’re ready, you can jump straight into the action!
</p><p>Speaking of action: with a few exceptions, <b>PvP Combat is enabled everywhere</b>, so make sure you’re fully prepared for each adventure before you set out. Trust us - it’s merciless out there.
</p><p>While progressing in Deadman worlds, you’ll benefit from a few perks, including:
</p>
<ul><li>Greatly accelerated XP rates</li>
<li>Certain quests completing automatically upon reaching various milestones</li>
<li>Item drop-rate modifiers</li>
<li>Access to unique drop tables and items not available in the main game</li>
<li>Improved shop restock rates</li>
<li>Sigils (similar to Relics from Leagues – more on that later)</li></ul>
<p>If you make significant progress during the season, you may qualify for the <b>Deadman: Reborn Finale</b> on September 17th – a brutal last stand where the top players hurtle into battle against one another, smashing each other to bits until a victor is crowned in the name of glory... oh, and a <b>$32,000 prize pool!</b>
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="What_You_Need_To_Know">What You Need To Know</span></h2>
<p>Deadman: Reborn starts at <b>12:00 BST</b> (30 minutes after our usual game update time.)
</p><p><i>As always, we refer to the in-game timings as cycles. Each cycle is equal to 0.6 seconds and is also commonly referred to as a 'tick' by the wider community.</i>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Starting_Off">Starting Off</span></h2>
<p>When logging into a Deadman: Reborn world for the first time, You are given the option to choose where you spawn by speaking to Skippy, so don't get comfy. From here you’ll be presented with a selection of Tier 2 Sigils, and you’ll need to choose one to begin your journey:
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Sigil_of_the_Ruthless_Ranger:">Sigil of the Ruthless Ranger:</span></h3>
<p>Upon dealing ranged damage, you have a 10% chance of crippling the target's movement. The effect deals 5 damage over the next 6 seconds and drains a total of 30 run energy in that time. The damage is doubled against targets with no energy. A target can only be under the influence of one crippling effect at a time. You also gain an additional 50% XP in the Ranged skill.
</p><p><br />
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Sigil_of_the_Feral_Fighter:">Sigil of the Feral Fighter:</span></h3>
<p>Upon dealing melee damage, for the next 12 seconds you have a 10% chance of gaining an attack speed with melee of 1.8 seconds for the next 3 attacks. You also have an additional 25% XP on your attack and strength skills.
</p><p><br />
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Sigil_of_the_Menacing_Mage:">Sigil of the Menacing Mage:</span></h3>
<p>Upon dealing magic damage, you have a 10% chance of cursing the target. The curse deals 12 damage over the next 6 seconds, and heals you for the same amount. A target can only be under the influence of one curse at a time. You also gain an additional 50% XP in the Magic skill.
</p>
<div class="center"><div class="floatnone"><a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/File:Deadman_Reborn_(2).png" class="image"><img alt="Deadman Reborn (2).png" src="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/images/Deadman_Reborn_(2).png?3bb15" decoding="async" width="600" height="501" data-file-width="462" data-file-height="386" /></a></div></div>
<p>While the Sigils offered are always the same, you’ll be able to pick a different one to kick-start your journey into the wild each time you die, increasing your overall power level and offering a little variety with each attempt. If you lose all your lives and have to completely start again, you'll be allowed to pick any of the three starting Sigils. These starting sigils cannot be traded on the Grand Exchange until you get to the 71-100 or 101-126 worlds.
</p><p>Once your first Sigil is chosen, you'll have 15 minutes of protection while you prepare yourself for the dangerous road ahead. <i>Note: you can remove this protection at any time by speaking to the Doomsayer in Lumbridge.</i>
</p><p>Once you begin your journey you will recieve a Starter Kit, which will also be given to you upon losing your third life! You'll also be able to claim Starter Kits from the Combat tutors. These can be claimed once per day, are untradeable, and cannot be used in PvP.
</p><p>Each pack gives you a Staff which comes charged with the equivalent of 500 Fire strikes, a Bow which is charged with the equivalent of 2,000 bronze arrows, and a Scimitar wieldable from level 1 Attack that is equivalent to a Mithril scimitar.
</p><p>Your pack also contains a Combat potion, and 12 cooked Tunas. The once per day limit is reset after losing your final life, allowing you to claim a new starter pack to help with the Combat Experience Rebuild! <i>Supplies contained within the starter packs are untradeable.</i>
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Safe_Zones">Safe Zones</span></h2>
<p>Need a breather? Safe zones are scattered throughout Gielinor. PvP Combat is fully disabled in these areas – players cannot attack each other or be attacked. You can take the pressure off at the following locations:
</p><p><b>No-PvP zones:</b>
</p>
<ul><li>Barbarian Assault Combat Arenas</li>
<li>Random Event Areas</li>
<li>Tutorial Island</li></ul>
<p><b>Guarded areas:</b>
</p>
<ul><li>Catherby (Bank area only)</li>
<li>East Ardougne (not including the unicorn cage or the rooftops)</li>
<li>Falador</li>
<li>Jatizso (within the town walls only)</li>
<li>Kourend Castle (not including the courtyard)</li>
<li>Lumbridge</li>
<li>Neitiznot (within the town walls only)</li>
<li>Port Phasmatys (not including the Ectofuntus)</li>
<li>Prifddinas Tower of Voices</li>
<li>Rellekka (not including piers or the northern crabs)</li>
<li>Seers' Village bank (downstairs only)</li>
<li>Sophanem (not including the underground bank)</li>
<li>Tree Gnome Stronghold (not including Brimstail's house)</li>
<li>Underwater area from Recipe for Disaster</li>
<li>Varrock</li>
<li>Void Knight Outpost (not including the combat island)</li>
<li>Yanille (not including the city walls or Watchtower)</li></ul>
<p>Skulled players (see below) can’t simply jump into safe zones, by the way. Should a skulled player try, a Deadman guard will appear and attack with Ranged every game cycle, starting at 1/5th of the player’s max hit points, increasing by 2 damage with each attack. Yikes! Fortunately, exiting the safe zone will de-spawn 'em.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Skulling,_Bank_Keys_&amp;_Safe_Deposit_Boxes">Skulling, Bank Keys &amp; Safe Deposit Boxes</span></h2>
<p>Attacking another player will give you a PK skull for five minutes. Should you successfully take down your opponent, you will receive their Bank Key alongside any unprotected items they were carrying at the time – and you’ll be granted one minute of immunity from other players. This is your chance to loot like mad and then make a break for safety!
</p>
<div class="center"><div class="floatnone"><a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/File:Deadman_Reborn_(3).png" class="image"><img alt="Deadman Reborn (3).png" src="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/images/Deadman_Reborn_(3).png?3bb15" decoding="async" width="500" height="519" data-file-width="308" data-file-height="320" /></a></div></div>
<p><i>Note: If you attack another player within this minute then you will lose any remaining immunity you had. The immunity period will also be lost upon logging out.</i>
</p><p>The Bank Key is a clever little item – you can use it to unlock chests in safe zones, which contain the top 10 most valuable items from your opponent’s Bank. If you have taken your opponent’s last life that's even better, as you will get their 28 most valuable items.
</p><p>You can only carry a maximum of five Bank Keys at any given time. Should you wish to continue fighting with five Keys, any items that would have been included within a Key will instead drop to the ground.
</p><p><i>Note: It is not possible to claim loot from a Bank Key while skulled.</i>
</p><p>Feeling sentimental about a particular item or items you’re carrying? You can protect up to 10 of your favourite things by chatting to the Financial Wizards, who are found within Banks in any safe zones. They can stow 10 items in a secure Safe Deposit Box. You will not lose these items if killed... unless you lose your last life, of course. Should the worst happen, you’ll lose the entire contents of your Bank and Deposit Box, so don’t let your guard down!

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Three_Life_System">Three Life System</span></h2>
<p>A new feature of Deadman: Reborn is the Three Life System. Which, as you might have guessed, means each player starts their adventure with three lives. Upon dying in PvP combat, you lose a life along with all items you had equipped, which go to the player who defeated you (plus a Bank Key containing the top 10 most valuable items from your Bank). Using the Protect Item Prayer will not protect any additional items on PvP death.
</p><p>When dying to another player, untradeable items will act as they do in Wilderness deaths. The items will revert to a broken state and need repairing before they can be used again. The PKer will receive coins as a reward.
</p><p>Should you lose your final life in PvP, the contents of your Safe Deposit Box, plus the remaining most valuable banked items (up to a total of 28) go to the PKer. Treat those lives carefully! Here's some important info to note once your last life is lost:
</p>
<ul><li>You respawn with a fresh supply of lives and 15 minutes of protection.</li>
<li>All attuned and unattuned Sigils are lost.</li>
<li>You must choose a new Tier 2 Sigil.</li>
<li><b>Combat XP is fully reset</b> (this includes: Attack, Defence, HP, Magic, Prayer, Ranged and Strength).</li>
<li>All items within your Bank and Safe Deposit Box are wiped.</li>
<li>All items within Death's Coffer and any points stored with the Emblem Trader Store are wiped.</li>
<li>10% of all Skilling experience is lost.</li>
<li>Quest progress is <b>not reset</b> (any quests you complete during the qualifiers will stay complete – permanently)!</li></ul>
<p>A non-PvP death won't affect your current lives and the process is exactly the same as in the main game – a gravestone appears at the place you perished, and you must reclaim your items.
</p><p>The Starter Pack restriction will reset after losing your final life, allowing you to claim a new Starter Pack to help with the combat experience rebuild. Items within Death's Coffer and the Emblem Trader Store will be wiped upon losing your last life.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Combat_Level_Worlds">Combat Level Worlds</span></h2>
<p>To keep the combat exciting and give everyone a chance to flourish, Deadman: Reborn also introduces Combat Level worlds. These can only be accessed by players of a certain level, so you’ll only ever meet players with similar battle prowess. When you advance to a new world, you are given 60 minutes of protection.
</p><p>Worlds are divided into the following Combat Level brackets:
</p>
<ul><li>Level 3-35</li>
<li>Level 36-70</li>
<li>Level 71-100</li>
<li>Level 101-126</li></ul>
<p>Having too high or low a level will prevent you from joining a world. This means you’ll need to be smart about trading with other players – while the Grand Exchange will be shared across all worlds, you won’t be able to trade with other players unless they’re able to log into the same Combat Level world as you.
</p><p>If you manage to gain a level that puts you into a higher bracket whilst you're in combat the following will happen:
</p>
<ul><li>You are unable to attack NPC's or players, but both can attack you.</li>
<li>You do not gain any experience from any sources.</li>
<li>You can only use a bank three times before being unable to open the bank again.</li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Combat_Rules">Combat Rules</span></h2>
<p>In previous Deadman modes, players could remain relatively safe by attacking NPCs in single-way combat, with little fear of being attack by someone else. As a result, ‘boxing’ NPCs became an easy escape.
</p><p>This time, the rules are a little different. A PJ timer of 16 game cycles (that's 9.6 seconds) will be running on all Deadman worlds, affording you a grace period where you cannot be attacked by another player while fresh from an encounter. This grace period is wiped upon teleporting.
</p><p>Anti-boxing measures will prevent players abusing this feature, and boxing is against the rules in Deadman: Reborn.
</p><p>Imagine Player A is attacking Player B. If Players A and B stop fighting each other, other players could step in to attack Player A instead... but because of the PJ Timer, they would need to wait 16 game cycles before they were able to do so.
</p><p>We’ll be introducing a PJ timer to all NPCs currently located in single-way combat areas. Once in combat with another player, PvP will always take priority. If a player is in a fight with an NPC, they cannot be attacked by another player until they have defeated the NPC. By the same token, if the player is out of combat with an NPC and gets into a fight with another player, it will not be possible for NPCs to attack either player for 9.6 seconds.
</p><p>Players must wait 12 game cycles (7.2 seconds) before being able to teleport or log out while in combat.
</p><p>You won’t be able to teleport immediately after leaving combat with an NPC – you’ll need to wait 11 game cycles (6.6 seconds) first. This does not apply to any NPCs that you attack while concealed in a safespot, though you will be susceptible to another player's attacks in these instances.
</p><p>Alongside the introduction of an NPC PJ timer, we’ll be changing certain areas of the world that are currently multi-way combat to single-way combat:
</p>
<ul><li>Lunar Isle</li>
<li>Bandit Camp</li>
<li>Shadow Dungeon</li>
<li>Barbarian Village</li>
<li>White Wolf Mountain</li></ul>
<p>The only area to feature singles-plus combat will be within the Revenant Caves.
</p><p>While we’re on the subject, special spear attacks will no longer push players from single-way to multi-way combat zones. No more prodding your way into a multi-way scuffle!
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="XP_Multiplier">XP Multiplier</span></h2>
<p>We're going to increase the XP rates of all skills by 10x, including any reward XP you would normally receive from quests and/or XP Lamps. This increase applies throughout Gielinor. All XP multipliers from worlds and from Sigils are multiplicative.
</p><p>Combat XP will increase even further based on which Combat Level world you are playing in:
</p>
<ul><li>Level 3-35 = 10x Combat Experience</li>
<li>Level 36-70 = 15x Combat Experience</li>
<li>Level 71-100 = 20x Combat Experience</li>
<li>Level 101-126 = 25x Combat Experience</li></ul>
<p>Please note you will not receive any XP during PvP encounters, though fake XP drops will appear to indicate how much you would have gained.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Quest_&amp;_Automatic_Unlocks">Quest &amp; Automatic Unlocks</span></h2>
<p>In previous Deadman modes, we unlocked various quests automatically to help speed up player progression. This time our approach is slightly different.
</p><p>Instead of unlocking a bunch of quests on your first log-in, we’ll be tying unlocks into the Combat Level worlds. By reaching the next tier world, you’ll automatically unlock certain quests and any quest requirements that are relevant to your level of progression. Note: Recipe for Disaster will still require most pre-requisite quests to be completed, regardless of increased access to the Culinaromancer's Chest.
</p><p>The following automatic unlocks will apply:

<li>All Visages</li>
<li>All Wilderness Boss Rings</li></ul>
</div></div>
<p>In addition to the modified drop-rates, we've increased the amount of resources you have upon entering the game. Here’s how:
</p>
<ul><li>In addition to the normal loot for killing them, Callisto, Venenatis, Vet'ion and the Chaos Elemental have a 1 in 3 chance of dropping a single 4-dose Saradomin brew.</li>
<li>In addition to the normal loot for killing them, Scorpia, Crazy Archaeologist and the Chaos Fanatic also have a 1 in 5 chance of dropping a single 4-dose Saradomin brew.</li>
<li>Dragons now drop double the amount of bones.</li>
<li>All loot from the Giant Mole will be doubled.</li>
<li>All herb drops will be doubled.</li>
<li>Bronze to Rune Defenders droprate will be doubled.</li>
<li>Tuna, Lobster, Swordfish, Shark, Karambwan, Dark Crab, and Anglerfish fishing spots will yield 3x the amount of fish resources.</li>
<li>All random un-noted herb drops from NPCs are now doubled.</li>
<li>The Giant Mole will now drop double the amount of Claws and Hides.</li>
<li>In Barrows there is a chance to obtain potions and potion ingredients. For potions, there is a 1/2 chance of gaining a stack of three 4-dose potions when you would roll on the Barrows armour table. You will receive either Saradomin brews, Super Restores, Ranging potions, or Super Combat potions. There is a small chance of obtaining potion ingredients on the normal Barrows table. Also, due to limitations of the Barrows interface, it's possible that any items gained may instead appear in your Inventory or on the floor. You could receive the following: Crushed Nests, Red Spiders' Eggs, Wine of Zamorak, Limpwurt Roots, White Berries, or Grimy Torstol.</li>
<li>Potion supplies can now drop from Wildy Bosses (including demi-bosses).</li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Deadman-Only_Drop_Table">Deadman-Only Drop Table</span></h2>
<p>On top of those lovely increased drop rates, we’ll also be implementing a Deadman-only drop table for all NPCs! This means you could snag some extra loot from anyone or anything you defeat within Gielinor. This drop table includes the powerful Ancient Warrior’s weapons, Sigils, and resources such as food, potions, Herblore supplies and Emblems as well as some alchables, Master Wands, Mages Books and more powerful items that are typically obtained through other means.
</p><p>The odds vary according to the Combat level of the NPC you’re fighting. So, bosses generally have an increased chance – and with Superior Slayer creatures, it’s guaranteed.
</p><p><i>Note: The Ancient Warrior's weapons can be obtained by killing any NPCs, but creatures within the Wilderness have the highest chance of dropping them.</i>
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Restricted_Content_&amp;_Content_Changes">Restricted Content &amp; Content Changes</span></h2>
<p>Here's a look at the list of content restrictions for this version of Deadman. Anything not listed above will be available, including within the Finale, so make sure you strategise with this in mind:
</p>
<ul><li>Duel Arena, Castle Wars, Trouble Brewing, Fight Pits, Rat Pits, Pest Control and Last Man Standing are all inaccessible.</li>
<li>The Nature Rune Chest in East Ardougne is inaccessible.</li>
<li>Count Check will not be able to teleport players to the Stronghold of Security.</li>
<li>You cannot pickpocket NPCs in a safe zone.</li>
<li>The RPG is disabled and cannot be used.</li>
<li>Turael will not assign Kalphite tasks.</li>
<li>You cannot get Lava Dragon tasks.</li>
<li>Falo will not offer any Lava Dragon Bone master clues.</li>
<li>The Seedbox cannot be brought from Tithe Farm.</li></ul>
<p>We’ll also be making the following changes:
</p>
<ul><li>You'll have the ability to use the looting bag anywhere (except safe zones).</li>
<li>All Rune Shops, Arrow Shops, and Fletching and Crafting Stores restock at a much faster rate. Lower tier equipment will restock faster than higher tier equipment (for example, an Air Rune will restock faster than a Death Rune).</li>
<li>Items that are placed in shops and not part of their natural shop stock cost 5x more than they normally do. These items sold to the shops give 3x less for selling to them.</li>
<li>Some shops such as Zaff Staves have their own deadman shops. These will have increased restock rates.</li>
<li>Wilderness Slayer task creatures have a chance to drop Emblems.</li>
<li>Pyramid Tops, found at the Agility Pyramid, will turn to cash upon death.</li>
<li>If you die with or drop, a stack of Chinchompas, it will fall to the ground, and be visible to all players.</li>
<li>Measures remain in place to prevent door spamming.</li>
<li>Player Owned House pools are unavailable for three minutes after combat.</li>
<li>Teleblock will now last for 150 seconds, or for 75 seconds with Protect From Magic active.</li>
<li>Protect From Magic does not half the duration of bind spells.</li>
<li>Some items are converted to coins on PvP deaths.</li>
<li>A Safe Deposit Box can be found in both Banks within the Grand Tree.</li>
<li>You'll be able to lock XP by speaking to Nigel in Lumbridge. When XP locking is activated, all XP gain is blocked, including any quest and lamp rewards you would normally receive.</li>
<li>No longer required to complete Dragon Slayer to equip an Antifire Shield.</li>
<li>Players can access the Rune Shop in the Mage's Guild without completing Hand in the Sand.</li>
<li>You'll be allowed to skip the fight with Hammerspike and his gang in One Small Favour.</li>
<li>You can only engage the Black Knight Titan in combat with Excalibur, but you also have the option of talking to him to avoid the fight entirely.</li>
<li>For Clue Scrolls, the number of steps in order to complete one has been reduced:
<ul><li>Beginner: 1 step</li>
<li>Easy: 1-2 steps</li>
<li>Medium: 1-3 steps</li>
<li>Hard: 2-3 steps</li>
<li>Elite: 2-4 steps</li>
<li>Master: 3-4 steps</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>The Emblem trader also exists within Deadman: Reborn with Emblems being worth twice the main-game value. He is located outside of Edgeville Bank and offers the following items:

<p>Much like Relics from Leagues, Sigils are an additional layer of powerful buffs that will enhance your gameplay way beyond anything mere equipment or skill levels can provide!
</p><p>Unlike Relics, however, Sigils are not a permanent choice. You’ll have the flexibility to swap out and change your Sigils to complement whatever task working on, so long as you’re in a safe zone and not skulled. Simply attune to your chosen Sigil (making it untradeable) and you’ll benefit from its unique properties! When you’re ready to swap Sigils, un-attune from the Sigil and it will become tradeable once more.
</p>
<div class="center"><div class="floatnone"><a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/File:Deadman_Reborn_(6).png" class="image"><img alt="Deadman Reborn (6).png" src="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/images/Deadman_Reborn_(6).png?5613d" decoding="async" width="650" height="422" data-file-width="502" data-file-height="326" /></a></div></div>
<p>There are three tiers, each providing more powerful buffs than the last. The higher tiers of Sigils will only be available on higher Combat Level worlds.
</p><p>You can find a <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Deadman:_Reborn/Sigils" title="Deadman: Reborn/Sigils">full list of Sigils</a> from our amazing friends at the Old School Wiki!
</p><p>As stated earlier, when logging into a Deadman: Reborn world for the first time, or after losing your last life, you’ll be presented with a selection of Tier 2 Sigils. While the Sigils on offer are always the same in subsequent attempts, you’ll be able to pick a different one to kick-start your journey each time, increasing your overall power level.
</p><p>Additional Sigils can be obtained as drops from NPCs. They can also be bought from, or sold to, other players – although you’ll only be able to do this at the Grand Exchange.
</p><p>You can have up to three Sigils active at any one time, but only two can be Combat-related.
</p><p>Upon losing a life that is not your last, any attuned Sigils will remain safe and in your possession, but un-attuned Sigils in your inventory will be deleted. Losing your final life means all Sigils, attuned or not, will be lost forever.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Finale">Finale</span></h2>
<div class="center"><div class="floatnone"><a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/File:Deadman_Reborn_(7).gif" class="image"><img alt="Deadman Reborn (7).gif" src="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/images/thumb/Deadman_Reborn_(7).gif/800px-Deadman_Reborn_(7).gif?cee0c" decoding="async" width="800" height="533" srcset="/images/Deadman_Reborn_%287%29.gif?cee0c 2x" data-file-width="1080" data-file-height="720" /></a></div></div>
<p>Let's take a look at what you can expect from the Finals – and how to qualify!
</p><p>Firstly, here's how to secure your spot:
</p><p>The Deadman: Reborn Season will last for three weeks, with the Finale on <b>September 17th</b>. There will be no separate Tournament event and your account used within the Deadman: Reborn Season will be the same account used in the Deadman: Reborn Finale.
</p><p>For this version of Deadman, the top 2,048 ranked players will enter 1v1 fights. This will be based on Total Levels/HiScore ranking.
</p><p>The 2,048 players will have access to four worlds, each restricted to a maximum of 512 players. These worlds will be split across various regions – it’s likely there will be an NA West, NA East and two EU worlds.
</p><p>Each world will operate on a first-come, first-served basis. Once a world has a total of 512 players, it will not be possible for additional players to join.
</p><p>These players will then battle it out in a 1v1 setting until a total of 1,024 players remain. The remaining 1,024 players will then battle it out in a second round of 1v1s until a total of 512 players remain. These hardcore players will be granted access to the final 1v1 world.
</p><p>Once we reach the final 512 players, we’ll allow them to battle it out in our standard 1v1 format:
</p>
<ul><li>Round of 512</li>
<li>Round of 256</li>
<li>Round of 128</li>
<li>Round of 64</li>
<li>Round of 32</li>
<li>Round of 16</li>
<li>Quarterfinals</li>
<li>Semifinals</li>
<li>Finals</li>
<li>Deadman: Reborn victor is crowned!</li></ul>
<p>In the first round of the 1v1s, all players will be able to bank and change their setup as they please. This will also be an opportunity to change your attuned Sigils.
</p><p>Once the first round begins, banking will no longer be possible. Players who progress beyond the first arena will have their inventory wiped of supplies (food and potions) and for each fight thereafter we'll restore all health/stats/special attacks, as well as resupplying inventories. The supplies will consist of the following (note that if your inventory is full then any excess supplies will fall to the floor):
</p>
<ul><li>1x Saradomin brew (4)</li>
<li>1x Super restore (4)</li>
<li>1x Sanfew serum (4)</li>
<li>1x Super combat (2)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Rules_&amp;_Reporting">Rules &amp; Reporting</span></h2>
<p>All existing <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://www.jagex.com/en-GB/terms/rules-of-runescape">RuneScape rules</a> apply during the Deadman Finale.
</p><p>Anyone who has been caught cheating in any Jagex event may be suspended from all future events. Jagex staff will review cases and players.
</p><p>Players found to be abusing game mechanics to gain an advantage in a way considered to be unsporting will be removed from Deadman: Reborn immediately.
</p>
<ul><li>Using Combat with an allied player during Deadman: Reborn is considered to be using a game mechanic to gain an unfair advantage. Players found to be abusing any of the above will be met with a three day ban along with disqualification from the Finale.</li></ul>
<p>The act of muling during the Season is prohibited, and is a bannable offence. This refers to the storing of items on another account to prevent them being lost in PvP situations.
</p><p>Boxing other players is also against the rules in Deadman: Reborn. In addition to this, attempting to ‘x-log’ with an NPC is against the rules and will result in the same punishment as boxing.
</p><p>In addition to the above, the following rules also apply to Deadman: Reborn:
</p>
<ul><li>During the 1v1 stage, should a player experience connectivity issues and log out before a fight begins, that player has until the fight begins to log back in.</li>
<li>During the 1v1 stage, should credible evidence emerge to suggest that an account is maliciously targeting other players, we will take action against them.</li>
<li>We will not, at any point or under any circumstances, restart the Finale.</li>
<li>We will endeavour to announce the results of the Finale on the night of the event, but should more investigation be required, the results will be announced only after the Old School team has met and reviewed all evidence available to us.</li></ul>
<p>We've also added to new reporting options to the Report Abuse screen, which is only available across Deadman worlds and specifically relates to muling and boxing:
</p>
<ul><li>16: Boxing in the Deadman Qualifiers and Finale</li>
<li>17: Muling in the Deadman Qualifiers and Finale</li></ul>
<p>If you suspect any of these two new rules have been breached, you can access the Report Abuse screen from the bottom of your Chatbox.
</p><p>That's everything you need to know about Deadman: Reborn! We look forward to seeing you all in game trying out the newest version of Old School's most brutal PvP experience!
